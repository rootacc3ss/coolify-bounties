I will add you to this repository and ideally, we collaborate on the full plan and system inside here + share code snippets, keep repolists for the repositories that are being worked on, etc.

## Planned Bounties
*None have been reserved so far.*

- **[$35]** Better Cloudflared/Cloudflare management tools (easy exclusions and inclusions by project, IP, etc... manage domains and subdomains via Cloudflare Zero Trust or DNS settings automatically -- or at least though a portal of some sort)
- **[$15]** Improved Supabase template (easily configure mail server for automated mail, set up external S3 with ease, etc -- I can contribute what I have learned from messing with the template)
- **[$25]** Working MailCow OR Stalwart+Roundcube "Service" template... It's time...
- **[$XXX]** CoolifyAI -- add API key, get AI assistant w/ knowledge-base similar to the Supabase assistant, ideally with GitHub issue lookup and basic research capability  
- **[$XXX - $X,XXX]** More proper, fleshed out "Services" template system WITH ability to add remote repositories outside of the official Coolify templates; setup scripting w/ select-able options, easily modify docker template or automations/commands with checkboxes, dropdowns and input fields and the works. Ideally, a system in which "addons" in these same repositories as the whole "Services" themselves can be added on to each individual service; I.e. for Cloudflared, my request above. Or for Supabase, an easy tool to help you visualize the parts missing from Selfhosted that are in Supabase SaaS/Cloud and perhaps an API to interface with it. **This would make Coolify the single self-hosted PaaS with scripting for templates, but also an extension system allowing new functionality.**
